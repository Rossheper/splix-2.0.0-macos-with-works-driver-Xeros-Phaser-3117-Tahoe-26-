This is based on fork splix-2.0.0-macos.

I've recompile this on MacOS Taheo 26.0.1.
I tested it using a M1 Pro Macbook Pro 14 and a Xeros Phaser 3117.

You probably need to install the xcode command line utils:
xcode-select --install

In case your printer needs jbig:
brew install jbigkit

make
sudo make install

To compile without jbig:
make DISABLE_JBIG=1
sudo make install
