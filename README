This is based on splix-2.0.0 (see initial commit).

I've modified this to compile on MacOS 12.3.
I tested it using a M1 Macbook Air and a Samsung ML-1520.

You probably need to install the xcode command line utils:
xcode-select --install

In case your printer needs jbig:
brew install jbigkit

make
sudo make install

To compile without jbig:
make DISABLE_JBIG=1
sudo make install

Check INSTALL :o)
